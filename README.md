Hospital API
This is a Node.js and MongoDB-based API for managing doctors and patients at a hospital allocated by the government for COVID-19 testing, quarantine, and patient well-being. The API allows doctors to register, log in, create patient reports, and retrieve patient information. Patients can register and view their reports. The API includes authentication for certain routes and follows a scalable folder structure.
